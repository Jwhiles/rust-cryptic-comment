# RUST CrYPtiC ComMMENT
## WHAT IS IT
A simple comment system, designed to be dropped into a silly website that could use comments. For example, [my website](www.johnwhiles.com). It makes commentors pay to post comments.

### WHy?
I think making people pay to use your website is probably an easy and effective way to avoid spam. Also because I wanted to understand wot a crypto is. Also I wanted to write RUST.

### INSPIRATION
* Smart Parking Meters
* Having seen comments on other websites

## How to Use it
WIP

You need
RUSTUP
NPM
THE NEAR CLI

Then run `make` in your command line and follow the help I guess?
