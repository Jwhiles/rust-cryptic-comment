* it doesn't work in an iframe, so I want to publish a npm package, which will export a function that takes a element id, and a contract id, then renders it into the screen. I can they just add a div to every page that wants comments, and a script that loads the thing and runs..

* Add timestamps to comments
* Come up with sensible scheme for post ids, also how they should be created
  * Do I just write a script that I run whenever I publish something? 
  * If the post_id doesn't exist - maybe add a button that creates the post, only I will be able to call it though

* stlylin for blog post and comments

* Create post through the UI
* Make it clear blog is example blog anyone could create. Include button to 'create your own blog' which is link to Github
* ... Make Github instructions to deploy own contract
